# TwitterApp
Repository to store twitter integration
This is a testing app that interacts with Twitter. The app can be scaled further to add new functionalities like Tweet to an account.
Few Notes: 
* Urls/Auth keys are stored in config file as they can be changed in future. Best practice is to store them in DB in an encrypted form.
* URLs and authorization details/example can be viewed at twitter developer community: https://developer.twitter.com/en/community"
The number of counts are fixed to 10 but screen name text is editable. You can type in a valid twitter user name to get the latest 10 tweets. (Salesforce is the default user name)
